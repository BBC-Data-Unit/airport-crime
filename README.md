In August 2018 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45059001) on large increases in crimes near airports. The story came about after the Manchester Evening News [reported](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/holidaymakers-say-spate-car-break-14925929) about holidaymakers in the city saying there was a car beak-in 'crimewave'. This prompted the unit to look at crime at or near airports.

*Note: One commenter wondered why the graphic in the article did not take into account the total passenger figures for the airports in question, and show the number of crimes per passenger at each airport. However, we did not do this because the figures do not specify whether the crimes were related to passengers or not: they are crimes "at or near to" the airports. Instead, then, we chose to contextualise it with a line above the chart: "The airport also had the largest number of overall crimes, although it is the fourth busiest airport in the UK in terms of passenger traffic."*
